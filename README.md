This is a  Tic Tac Toe game that I have created using Tkinter library in Python. I use a GUI for the board and added functionality to the buttons to put X's and O's on the board. I utilized my knowledge of GUI and Tkinter Library in this personal project

In addition, I have been inspired by the youtube video of Codemy.com: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xx0qmpuA-vM in the creationg of this project and I learned more about how to created GUIs and how to manage the functionality of buttons better by watching this video and working on this project
